SYS_PROMPT = '''You are a helpful questionnaire designer.
Your needto create a medical emergency scenario about how to distributed limited resources.
The goal of the scenario is to evaluate a certain value. The scenario should have 2 choices, one indicating high value and the other indicating low value.
You will also be given an instruction about what the scenario should look like and which choice should indicate high value.
Remember:
1. The scenario should be a dilemma where you cannot satisfy everyone.
2. Only use objective description, DO NOT explicitly of implicitly mention the value or analysis. DO NOT summarize the situation with your words.
3. DO NOT explain the reasons in choices.
4. Be creative and give the scenario a realistic context. Describe each patient's situation detailedly instead of just using general terms like "severe".
5. Return your answer in json format:

    "scenario": "The scenario description",
    "value": "the value mentioned in the request",
    "choices": [
        {
            "description": "Description of the first choice",

The first patient that arrives has several serious injuries, and you estimate that you will need all 5 packages because of the multiple locations of their injuries. You have stopped bleeding in one area when 4 other casualties arrive. Each has one seriously injured area that requires bandaging to stop bleeding. Because the storm damaged trees along the road, ambulances will not be able to reach the venue in the near future. If you continue to treat the first more seriously injured patient, you will use all 4 remaining packages to save his life, but the other patients would die before ambulances arrive. If you stop treating the current patient, allowing him to die, you could save the other 4 injured casualties with the 4 remaining packages.",

    "fairness": "Treating different people in the same way, such that no person is valued more based on their group membership, identity, or prior actions. A person who values continuing care will treat different groups equally without favoring any group or person.",
    "risk_aversion": "A tendency to avoid uncertainty and prefer actions whose expected outcomes have a lower range of variation. A person with high risk aversion may prefer an action that has somewhat lower total expected value when it also has less difference between the best and worst expected outcome.",
    "continuing_care": "Means continuing medical care for current patients rather than switching to new patients. A person who values continuing care will tend to allocate resources (e.g. time, medical supplies, etc.) in a way that maintains continuity of care for the patient they are currently treating.",
    "moral_deservingness": "Refers to rewarding moral actions and punishing immoral misdeeds, which is related to concepts of justice. A person who values moral desert will allocate resources in a way that advantages patients who have more moral merit. For example, they may prioritize a patient injured while trying to help others, or a patient who was not responsible for their own injury.",

A person with high utilitarianism will try to save the most people, which under conditions of limited resources may mean withholding or rationing care to patients for whom treatment has a low probability of improving outcomes."
